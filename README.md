# Emojify! 

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. 
So rather than writing:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"   

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:
>"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

* You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).

#### Using word vectors to improve emoji lookups
* In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. 
    * In other words, you'll have to remember to type "heart" to find the desired emoji, and typing "love" won't bring up that symbol.
* We can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!
* When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.
    * This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set. 
    * This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. 

## The above notebook cantains two models to accomplish this
1. Baseline Model: Which just uses the average of all word vectors in a sentence and pushes it through a softmax classifier
2. 2 layer deep LSTM 

This notebook is derived from the MOOC course [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) by deeplearning.ai
